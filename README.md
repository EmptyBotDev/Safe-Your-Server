⚙️ Self Host

We don't share this project to be selfhosted, however. Here's quick tutorial how-to:

1. Download the project.
2. Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. Open the project and type: ```npm i``` (This is to install all dependencies that it requires).
4. Open `example.config.js`, copy that and fill it in. Paste all info in a new file called `config.js`.
5. Type in the terminal ```npm start``` and it's now running!
6. Leave a star on this project ;)
